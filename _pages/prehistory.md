# NLP at Stanford before the Stanford NLP Group 

The first computational linguistics/NLP faculty at Stanford was 
[Joyce Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Friedman) (1928–2018; at Stanford 1965–1968). She joined Stanford
Computer Science the year the department was founded (although several
CS faculty had been at Stanford earlier in the Department of
Mathematics) and was the first woman on the CS Faculty. However, she
moved in 1968 to the University of Michigan and then later to Boston
University. She was President of the Association for Computational
Linguistics in 1971 (again, as the first female president).
Joyce worked on quite linguistic topics, such as implementing
Chomsky's _Aspects_-era transformational grammar and formal reasoning.
She was the advisor of several people who later became prominent
including David Scott Warren and C. Ray Perrault (who in turn was the
PhD advisor of James Allen).

The other prominent early language technology person was Raj
Reddy (1937–; Stanford PhD student 1963–1966; Stanford CS faculty
1966–1969; thereafter at Carnegie Mellon University). Raj came to Stanford before the CS department was created and
worked with John McCarthy. He has described how at that  time either
“you did numerical analysis or AI with McCarthy”. He
began working on speech recognition during his PhD at
Stanford. You can watch [the Hear Here
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKG5cudqoU) on this project
from 1968 on YouTube. Raj continued on with this topic, later receiving a Turing
Award for his pioneering research on speech recognition. PhD students
of Raj Reddy include James Gosling, Kai-Fu Lee, Roni Rosenfeld, and
Alex Waibel.

The next NLP faculty at Stanford CS was Roger Schank (1946–2023;
Stanford CS faculty 1968–1973). Roger Schank 
Three of the 2025 Stanford NLP faculty are academic descendants of
Roger Schank, as shown in the below partial family tree.
