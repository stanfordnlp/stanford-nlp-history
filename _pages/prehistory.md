# NLP at Stanford before the Stanford NLP Group 

## Joyce Friedman

The first computational linguistics/NLP faculty at Stanford was 
[Joyce Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Friedman) (1928–2018; at Stanford 1965–1968). She joined Stanford
Computer Science the year the department was founded (although several
CS faculty had been at Stanford earlier in the Department of
Mathematics) and was the first woman on the CS Faculty. However, she
moved in 1968 to the University of Michigan and then later to Boston
University. She was President of the Association for Computational
Linguistics in 1971 (again, as the first female president).
Joyce worked on topics such as implementing
Chomsky's _Aspects_-era transformational grammar and formal reasoning.
She was the advisor of several people who later became prominent
including David Scott Warren and C. Ray Perrault (who in turn was the
PhD advisor of James Allen).

## Raj Reddy

The other prominent early language technology person was [Raj
Reddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Reddy) (1937–; Stanford PhD student 1963–1966; Stanford CS faculty
1966–1969; thereafter at Carnegie Mellon University). Raj came to Stanford before the CS department was created and
worked with John McCarthy. He has described how at that  time either
“you did numerical analysis or AI with McCarthy”. He
began working on speech recognition during his PhD at
Stanford. You can watch [the Hear Here
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKG5cudqoU) on this project
from 1968 on YouTube. Raj continued on with this topic, later receiving a Turing
Award for his pioneering research on speech recognition. PhD students
of Raj Reddy include James Gosling, Kai-Fu Lee, Roni Rosenfeld, and
Alex Waibel.

## Roger Schank

The next NLP faculty at Stanford CS was [Roger Schank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank) (1946–2023;
Stanford CS faculty 1968–1973).

Roger Schank was a controversial and
mercurial figure in NLP, but he left a broad legacy.
Three of the 2025 Stanford NLP faculty are academic descendants of
Roger Schank, as shown in the below partial family tree.

- Jacob Mey *(a linguist specializing in pragmatics)*
    * **Roger Schank**
        - Eduard Hovy
		    + **Diyi Yang**
		- Jaime Carbonell
		    + Manuela Veloso
			+ Masaru Tomita
			+ Hieu Pham
		- Gerald DeJong
		    + Jude Shavlik
			+ Ray Mooney
		- Wendy Lehnert
		    + Claire Cardie
			    - **Yejin Choi**
		- Robert Wilensky
		    + Peter Norvig
			+ James Martin
			+ Marti Hearst
			+ **Dan Jurafsky**

## Terry Winograd

Roger Schank was followed by [Terry
Winograd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Winograd) (1946–;
Stanford CS faculty 1973–2012). Winograd’s most famous NLP system was
SHRDLU, the blocks world that he wrote for his PhD prior to coming to
Stanford. Here is [a video of
SHRDLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAJz4YKUwqw). Terry became
disillusioned with the symbolic AI methods he had been trained in, and
by around 1984, he had stopped doing AI and hence NLP, and began to
reinvent himself as an human-computer interaction researcher. He
founded the [Stanford HCI Group](https://hci.stanford.edu/) and for many years was its only faculty member.

## The (Stanford) NLP Winter 🥶

There was no speech/NLP research at Stanford for 15 years, 1984–1999.

There was NLP Research at nearby labs: SRI, Xerox PARC, and HP, and at
further away places like IBM Research (Yorktown Heights) and Bell
Labs. Martin Kay was 50% in Stanford Linguistics but his research was
done at PARC. A number of Stanford Linguistics and Computer Science
Students did complete PhDs on computational linguistic topics during
this period by working at one or other of those labs. They include:
Mark Johnson (1987), Dan Flickinger (1988), Stuart Shieber (1989), and
David Magerman (1994).

NLP was institutionally weak in the US overall during this
period. There were no NLP faculty at MIT, UC Berkeley, Princeton,
U. Washington, or UIUC either. The only places with multiple NLP
faculty were U. Penn, Carnegie Mellon University, Johns Hopkins, and
Georgetown. There were individual NLP faculty at a bunch of other
schools including Columbia, Cornell, and Rochester.


## Our Linguistics-Heavy Origins

As well as the Schank academic family tree originating from
linguistics, this is also true of the other main family tree in our
group (somewhat generously counting a formative postdoc relationship
between Percy and Tatsu):

- Noam Chomsky
    - Joan Bresnan
	    - **Christopher Manning**
		    - Dan Klein
			    - **Percy Liang**
				    - **Tatsunori Hashimoto**
					
Chris Potts is himself a linguist descendant of linguists:

- Neil Smith *(a phonetician)*
    - Geoffrey K. Pullum
	   - **Christopher Potts**
		
This leaves Monica Lam as the only Stanford NLP faculty (up to 2025) who is not
descended from a linguist, as far as we know:

- Joseph Traub *(a physicist)*
    - Hsiang-Tsung Kung
	    - **Monica Lam**
