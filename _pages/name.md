# The name “Stanford NLP Group”

## The name

The name “Stanford NLP Group” reflected two dispreferences of Chris Manning against the
common pattern of using names like “Smith Lab” (perhaps
because of his linguistics background?): He disapproved of naming
groups after professors, when students are the mainstay of the
research of any group and he thought using “lab” was a little silly
when actually there was never going to be any laboratory for the group.
(Nevertheless, another early name he considered was the Language
Technology Research Laboratory (LaTeRaL), reflecting enthusiasm for
the more inclusive term “Language Technology” at the time. Because of
this, the first two computers of the group, both Sun workstations,
were called `nlp` and `lateral`. `nlp` has been replaced several
times, but a machine with this name remains our webserver,
`nlp.stanford.edu`.)

## Spread of the (University|Place) NLP pattern

The name was normally shortened on web pages, slides, and twitter to
**“Stanford NLP”**. This was not a naming pattern that had previously been
used, as far as we were aware. Some existing groups had particular
names for their center: CLSP at JHU, IRCS at U. Penn, CMT and later
LTI at CMU, UMIST at Manchester, CLEAR at U. Colorado, Boulder. Others
were either named after people like “James Allen’s group” or unnamed
faculty and their students, such as for Eugene Charniak at Brown or
Kathy McKeown at Columbia. In the 21st Century, our naming pattern
spread to be the naming pattern of most NLP Groups in the US and
internationally:
