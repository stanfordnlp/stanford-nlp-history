# An emphasis on education

The Stanford NLP Group has always placed a heavy emphasis on
education, both at Stanford and worldwide.

## Textbooks

Externally, we have been lead authors of three of the leading language
technology textbooks.

## Online classes

We have worked hard to make our courses available to the world. We
offered the first ever NLP MOOC and have followed up by pioneering in
making some of our Stanford courses available in their entirety on
YouTube and for professional audiences via Stanford Online.

## Classes at Stanford

On campus, after a fairly quiet first decade, enrollment in our NLP
classes has boomed by more than an order of magnitude. The first boom
in enrollment came during the early neural NLP era (2012–2022), though
things have certainly intensified again in the era of ChatGPT!
