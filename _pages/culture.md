# The culture of the Stanford NLP Group

If we may pat ourselves on the back a little, the Stanford NLP Group
has generally been recognized for its positive culture as a group.

Some of the central attributes that we have emphasized that are
important to that culture are:

- Maintain interdisciplinarity
- Have active mentorship at every level
- Implement ideas and make them available to others to achieve impact
- Invest actively in community maintenance

In recent years, Dan Jurafsky in particular has assumed the central
role in maintaining Stanford NLP Group culture – and ordering our food.

Since almost the beginning, Stanford NLP has had students in computer
science and linguistics, and also occasionally students from
psychology, electrical engineering, education, and computational and
mathematical engineering. While CS students have always dominated
numerically, we have always tried to give equal status and
opportunities to everyone. We believe that the CS students have
always benefited from their broader cross-disciplinary exposure in the
group, while non-CS students usually benefit from the AI mindset of
producing conference papers. 😊 Even when other universities have
students in varies departments working on NLP, it is very rare that
they actually have a unified group like ours.
