# Origins of the Stanford NLP Group: 1999–2003

Christopher Manning was hired and came to Stanford for Fall
1999, becoming an Assistant Professor filling a newly created joint
faculty position in Linguistics and Computer Science. Here are some
early photos of Chris at Stanford from the Fall 1999 CS Department
Retreat taken by Héctor García-Molina.

The next PhD students were Sep Kamvar, Roger Levy, Teg Grenager, and
then Jenny Finkel. (As usual, there then start to be some more
complicated situations: Teg later dropped out and, actually, Jenny was an MS CS student during this period,
but later a PhD student).

Other students and visiting faculty around the Stanford NLP Group during these early years
were: Mike Jahr, Tolga Ilhan, Mark Chavira, Kristen Parton, Joseph
Smarr, Huy Nguyen, Andrea Tompa, Miler Lee, Jim McFadden, Cindi
Thompson, Jeannette Pettibone, and Iddo Lev.

It's not completely clear when there was first something called “The
Stanford NLP Group”, but it definitely came into existence in the
year 2000. The first save of the group's website by the Internet
Archive is from 2000-10-29. Here's what the original page looked like:
